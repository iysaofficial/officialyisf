                                    Penelitian sederhana tentang pupuk cair dengan bahan utama kulit pisang, cangkang telur dan air cucian beras ini dinilai sangat relevan dengan keadaan saat ini. Kualitas pertanian di Indonesia bahkan di dunia saati ini mengalami penurunan secara signifikan seiring dengan semakin tidak produktifnya lahan pertanian akibat penggunaan pupuk kimia dan kurangnya rehabilitasi tanah itu sendiri. menurut salah satu tim KIR M. Rayyan Atthariq, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menghasilan pupuk organik yang mampu mengembalikan kondisi tanah menjadi subur kembali karena ketiga bahan tersebut telah dikenal memiliki kandungan nitrogen, phospar, kalium dan karbon yang merupakan unsur hara yang dibutuhkan oleh tanaman.
