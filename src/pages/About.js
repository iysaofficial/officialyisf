                    The number of creativity and idea development makes students
                    produce many products that are beneficial to society and the
                    environment. Creativity and the development of ideas as
                    outlined in the written work requires a place to evaluate
                    the results.

                    <br />
                    This event can be a place for creativity competitions for Elementary, Secondary, University, and Public (teachers, lecturers, researchers, companies, institutions, organizations). This event is expected to help evaluate the results of student research. Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA) in collaboration with University Diponegoro Faculty of Engineering, and BUCA IMSEF Turkey will hold the event â€œYouth International Science Fair (YISF).

                    For this year, YISF is back with the hope of being the right
                    place for researchers to evaluate the ideas and works that
